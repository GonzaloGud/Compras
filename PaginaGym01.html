        <p>
          POWER ® is a challenging muscle toning, strength and endurance
          training program that uses a barbell with interchangeable discs. POWER
          ® is cleverly designed to offer four class formats: Alpha, Beta, Gamma
          and Delta. Each format trains the muscle groups in different
          combinations and thus allows you to achieve better and faster results!

    <ol class="SupplementsClass">
      
      <li>Whey Protein Powder</li>
      <p>
        Why it made the list: Whey tops the list of mass-gain supplements
        because it’s the most crucial for pushing protein synthesis. Whey is a
        milk protein that has a high level of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs,
        No. 4 on our list). Bottom line: Whey takes the crown because it digests
        fast and gets to your muscles rapidly to start building muscle. Whey
        also contains peptides (small proteins) that increase blood flow to the
        muscles. This is why we always recommend consuming whey protein
        immediately after training.
      </p>
      <li>Creatine</li>
      <p>
        Why it made the list: Creatine is made from three amino acids: arginine,
        glycine and methionine. Anecdotal reports and scientific studies alike
        find that guys who take creatine gain a good 10 pounds or more of
        bodyweight and increase strength dramatically. Creatine works in a
        number of ways. For one, it increases the amount of fast energy in your
        muscles needed to perform reps in the gym. The more of this fast energy
        that’s available, the more reps you can do with a given weight, allowing
        you to get bigger and stronger in the long run. Creatine also draws more
        water into your muscle cells, placing a stretch on the cell that
        increases long-term growth. Most recently, creatine has been found to
        increase levels of insulin like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) in muscles,
        which is critical for stimulating growth.
      </p>
      <li>Branched-Chain Amino Acids (BCAAs)</li>
      <p>
        Why they made the list: The term branched-chain amino acids refers to
        leucine, isoleucine and valine, the absolute most important amino acids
        for repairing and building muscle tissue. Leucine is the most critical
        of the three, as research shows that it can stimulate muscle protein
        synthesis on its own. Yet it’s still best to take all three together,
        since they work in synergy to provide a multitude of benefits, including
        muscle growth, increased energy during workouts, the blunting of
        cortisol (a catabolic hormone that inhibits testosterone and increases
        muscle breakdown) and decreased delayed-onset muscle soreness.
      </p>
      <li>Beta-Alanine</li>
      Why they made the list: In the body, the amino acid beta-alanine is
      combined with another amino, histidine, to form carnosine. Research shows
      that when muscles have higher levels of carnosine, they have more strength
      and endurance. Carnosine appears to increase the muscle fibers’ ability to
      contract with more force, and to do so longer without fatiguing. Several
      studies reported increases in muscle strength and power in athletes who
      took beta-alanine. One recent study found that subjects who took
      beta-alanine along with creatine gained more muscle mass and lost more
      bodyfat than subjects who took only creatine.
      <li>Nitric Oxide</li>
      <p>
        Why they made the list: Nitric oxide (NO) is a molecule found throughout
        the body that’s involved in multiple processes. The one that
        bodybuilders are most interested in is its ability to dilate blood
        vessels, which allows more blood flow to the muscles for enhanced
        delivery of oxygen, nutrients, anabolic hormones and water (blood is
        mostly water). This gives you more energy during your workout, an
        enhanced muscle pump, and better muscle recovery and growth after the
        workout. NO boosters don’t provide NO, but rather the amino acid
        arginine, which is readily converted to NO in the body. Research has
        found that subjects who were given arginine increased muscle strength
        and growth and lost bodyfat.
